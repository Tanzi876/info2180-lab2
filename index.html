         <h2>Help Scout</h2>

                Sometimes, the best blog designs are also the 
                simplest. Help Scout, makers of customer service
             software, uses a unique but minimalist design on its
             blog that we love -- it limits the use of copy and 
             visuals and embraces negative space.<br>
             <br>What we particularly like about this blog is its 
             use of featured images for all posts, including a
             banner one at the top that highlights a recent or 
             particularly popular entry. These icons are set in 
             front of bright, block colors that catch the readers'
              eye and signal what the post is about. And it works 
              -- everything about this blog's design says "clean" 
              and "readable."

            <h2>Microsoft Stories</h2>
            <h5>June 12,2020.  Lindsay Kolowich Cox</h5>
            <p id="post">

                Full disclosure: We've totally gushed over 
                Microsoft's "Stories" microsite before. We 
                can't help it -- what better way to revitalize 
                n old-school brand than with a blog that boasts 
                beautiful, interactive, and inspiring branded 
                content? Plus, the square layout of these stories
                is reminiscent of the Microsoft logo, which 
                achieves a valuable brand consistency.<br> <br>
                Microsoft Stories is also a prime example of how
                a business blog can be a major asset for an
                overall rebrand. In recent years, Microsoft has 
                worked to humanize its brand, largely in response 
                to a rivalry with Apple. The "Stories" microsite has
                a simple tagline -- "Get an inside look at the people,
                places and ideas that move us." It's the softer side of 
                Microsoft, so to speak. <br><br>When you're trying to 
                convey a certain brand message, your blog can be used 
                to communicate it -- both aesthetically, and content-wise.
